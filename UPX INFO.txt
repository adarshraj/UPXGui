MPRESS 0.99
------------------------------------------------------------------

	* MPRESS is a free, high-performance executable packer for PE32/PE32+/.NET executable formats!
	* MPRESS makes programs and libraries smaller, and decrease start time when the application loaded from a slow 
	  removable media or from the network. It uses in-place decompression technique, which allows to decompress 
	  the executable without memory overhead or other drawbacks; it also protects programs against reverse engineering by non-professional
	  hackers. Programs compressed with MPRESS run exactly as before, with no runtime performance penalties.
